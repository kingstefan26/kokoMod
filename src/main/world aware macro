-- LOT OF WORK THINGS
 getting blocks in a specific area (don't know how to do that)
 pathfinding (also clueless)
 move based on the crop (hard code all positions/ angels & modify the pathfind to every crop aka. PAINNNN)

ON_ENABLE:
  if CONTEXT_REGISTRY is null
    get CONTEXT_REGISTRY
  if !CONTEXT_REGISTRY.isEmpty:
    -display CONTEXT_REGISTRY and ask "pick past farming context"
       get picked CONTEXT uuid from CONTEXT_REGISTRY

    -"create new farming context"

  else:
    call CONTEXT_CREATOR


FARM_LAYER_WIZARD_MANUAL:
 create island wide virtual square that is 5 blocks down and up relative to the player
 //LOT OF WORK
 somehow get blocks in that square
 make a guess on the the farm dimensions draw a square of the box
   ask if guess is correct
     if yes continue
     if wrong player can manually change
 discard all crop blocks
 draw the bounding box
 get block frequency
 figure out the building block
 get user position and ask if that is the start position
   if not ask again
   if correct
     search for a tp pad in bounding box
       tp_pad_location is null
         please place a tp pad in the farm
         return to ON_ENABLE
     return the FARM_LAYER object



FARM_LAYER_WIZARD_AUTO(JOB):
 get JOB farm_bounding_box
   move the box down in y
   //LOT OF WORK
   somehow get blocks in that square
   make a guess on the the farm_bounding_box
     if guess y = 0
       return null & "cloud not find a farm layer ABORT"
     if guess is wrong try again
     if guess correct
       discard all crop blocks
       get block frequency
       figure out the building block
       get last job position multiply by the y multiplier
       search for a tp pad
       new uuid
       return the FARM_LAYER object



FARM_LAYER:
 bounding box, block frequency, tp pad location, uuid, building block, starting position, crop type

CONTEXT:
 FARM_LAYER [], creation time, uuid, name, crop type

JOB:
 tp_pad_location, farm_bounding_box, start_position, desired_speed, parent_context_uuid

CONTEXT_REGISTRY:
 array of CONTEXT
 //LOT OF WORK
 saves/reads from file on creation or access
 isEmpty()
 getAllContexts()
 getters of CONTEXT with specific uuid
 setters of CONTEXT with specific uuid


JOB_EXECUTE_QUEUE:
 a place for a JOB object
 isEmpty()
 reset()
 hold()
 unhold()
 if hold is true get returns null
 setJOB()
 getJOB()


CONTEXT_CREATOR:
 get a name from user
 new context(FARM_LAYER_WIZARD_MANUAL(), current time, new uuid, name)
 add new CONTEXT to CONTEXT_REGISTRY
 return

 return new JOB(CONTEXT.FARM_LAYER[FARM_LAYER INDEX].tp_pad_location, CONTEXT.FARM_LAYER[FARM_LAYER INDEX].farm_bounding_box,
  CONTEXT.FARM_LAYER[FARM_LAYER INDEX].start_location, CONTEXT.desired_speed, CONTEXT.uuid)

LOAD_JOB(job):
  JOB_EXECUTE_QUEUE.setJOB(job)

UPDATE_JOB(last job):
 check PARENT_CONTEXT_ENTRY_GET/SET if current player location is in one of FARM_LAYERs
   if no
     call FARM_LAYER_WIZARD_AUTO with last job
     save the FARM_LAYER output to PARENT_CONTEXT_ENTRY_GET/SET and call itself recursively
   if yes
     get the matching FARM_LAYER INDEX from PARENT_CONTEXT_ENTRY_GET/SET
     call CONTEXT_TO_JOB with PARENT_CONTEXT_ENTRY_GET/SET and matching FARM_LAYER INDEX
     call LOAD_JOB with the output
